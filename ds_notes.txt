 
	# Points. 
1. In a tree if N nodes then  N-1 edges/links. 
2. Every child will have only one parent but parent can have multiple child. 
3.Tree is a reverse data structure.

4. Degree of nodes: - Total no. of children in any nodes. 
5. Degree of trees: - It is the heighest degree of nodes. 
6. Level of tree : - Top to bottom of any tree. Level counts from zero. & increment to one by one. 
7. Height of nodes. : - edge count from leaf node to particular noedes. edge count start from one. 
8. Height of tree : - Height of root nodes. 
9. Depth of tree : - Total no. of edges from root nodes to particular nodes.

		#  Heap  Data structure 

a. Binary heap
b. Binomial heap 
c. Fibonacci heap 
 
a. Binary heap : - complete binary tree which satisfies the heap property. 
		
		or 
Property of a node in which key of every parent node need to be lesser than or equal to or greater than or equal to the child node's key. 

	# min heap / min binary heap 

complete binary tree , where the key of every parent node is less than or equal to child nodes key. 

	# max heap / max binary heap 

complete binary tree, where the key of every parent node is greater than or equal to child nodes key.
